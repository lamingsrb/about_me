Experience- Creative Solutions - Examples

Making company work more efficient with my solutions

DevOps/Automatization/Python/AI

Problem:
-> EcomlyAds marketing agency faced significant manual work in handling new orders and processing them efficiently.
-> Orders received via their WordPress site only contained basic client information, insufficient for crafting the desired Video Ads.
Before:
-> Receive order via WordPress site.
-> Email containing client details.
-> Manual client contact for order specifics.
-> Forward details to video editors.
-> Send client link to the created video.
After:
-> Client receives an automatic popup form during purchase to input order details.
-> Submitted details are automatically emailed to the Agency.
-> Webhook triggers a Python script on a virtual machine, notifying the agency's team via a WP group of the new order.
-> Automatically creates a new task in Asana, assigning it to the editor with all necessary order information.
-> Upon video completion, the editor uploads it to a Dropbox folder.
-> Another script detects the upload and generates GIFs, ad copies, and marketing bonuses using OpenAI API and related libraries.
Result:
-> Automation reduced manual work by 90%, leading to increased client satisfaction due to faster order processing and additional value beyond the ordered video.
This is just a simple example of applying creative problem-solving thinking, which I thoroughly enjoy and am passionate about.

Networking

Problem:
-> A company with over 100 employees and more than 500 devices in its network is experiencing an interruption of internet service. A wide range of equipment (IP cameras, access control systems, computers, NAS servers, etc.) was affected.
-> The nation's largest seller of computer equipment cannot operate across the entire country due to service downtimes, resulting in significant financial losses on a daily basis and dissatisfied customers.
My Solution:
-> Complete network diagnostics revealed multiple routers with DHCP Service enabled, active in the same network.
-> Removed all routers except the main one, eliminating unnecessary routers and replacing them with suitable switches.
-> Scanned the network for inactive devices.
-> Removed all reserved IP addresses from inactive devices.
-> Reserved IP addresses on the main router for all critical systems in the network.
-> Established stable Internet connectivity and network operation for all devices.
-> As a result, the 3G Company continued to operate and avoided huge losses.
